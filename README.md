These notebook aims to replicate the work done by Susan Muller for the Union of Concerned Scientists, focusing on winter OSW analysis to determine the impact of turbines on ensuring grid reliability in winter months, as well as expand on what can be done with the ISONE data. 

The notebooks can be opened through google colab. Any edits made will not be reflected in the notebooks stored on github for everyone.
