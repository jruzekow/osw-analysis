# osw-analysis 
These notebook aims to replicate the work done by Susan Muller for the Union of Concerned Scientists, focusing on winter OSW analysis to determine the impact of turbines on ensuring grid reliability in winter months, as well as expand on what can be done with the ISONE data. 

The notebooks can be opened through google colab or jupyter lab. To do this through google colab: 

1) download the .ipynb file you wish to open
2) navigate to https://colab.research.google.com/
3) open the selected file to begin running

You can save a copy of the file in your personal google drive to make edits and further examine the data. The notebooks can also be used as the basis for understanding how to examine and analyze ISONE data. 

 - Notebook 1: Analysis of potential OSW installment on the winter month load. How does OSW reduce the number of days when the power system is in a state of elevated risk?
 - Notebook 2: Analysis of potential OSW installments on the load of non-winter months. Are non-winter months a concern for states of elevated risk, and does OSW play a big roll in limiting this?
 - Notebook 3: Analysis of potential OSW and solar installment on the winter month load. How does the addition of solar with OSW impact the number of days when the power system is in a state of elevated risk?
 - Notebook 4: Heatmap analysis and further plotting of winter OSW + solar. Plot images can be viewed without running the code in the "OSW and Solar Analysis Results.ppt".

Updates in Progress: 
- Notebook 4: Adding a heatmap that expressed the average number of days of elevated risk across all years.
